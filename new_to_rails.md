New to Rails?
=============

## Introduction
Rails is a web framework, written in Ruby, enabling developers to quickly build web applications by abstracting away many lower level details, allowing the developer to focus on the novel aspects of his application. Some of these details include baked-in support for routing (mapping URLs to actions), object-relational mapping (mapping objects to database tables), and emaling. The framework utilizes the MVC ([Model View Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)) paradigm to organize projects, providing separation of concerns and favors [Convention over Configuration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) and DRY ([Don't Repeat Yourself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)) to maintain simplicity.

## Learning Resources

### Getting Started
Getting Started with Rails is an official Rails guide that "covers getting up and running with Ruby on Rails." It provides an excellent starting place for someone completely new to Rails.
- [Getting Started with Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

### Ruby On Rails Tutorial
The Ruby on Rails Tutorial is a very high quality tutorial that provides newbies with everything they
need to become literate in Rails. Students following the tutorial learn by example and completion of the book
results in the creation of a complete Rails application. Hartl focuses on writing good, clean, testable code, and provides a solid
foundation for those looking to utilize Rails for their own projects (including Sozogo!).

### Rails for Zombies
Rails for Zombies provides a fun, engaging, informative introduction to Rails and is great for anyone wanting to get their feet wet. The course is completely online, so no time is lost setting up a development environment. After completing the first Rails for Zombies course, there are additional courses for those wanting to learn
more about other, more advanced, techniques.

### Rails IRC Channel (#rubyonrails)
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a protocol facilitating chat-room-like communication. While overall usage of IRC has declined over the past decade, many developers
still actively utilize this form of communication. Ruby on Rails has a very active IRC channel that is invaluable for both beginner and seasoned developers. A few things to note:
- You will have to download an IRC client. [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) and [LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/) are popular for OSX, while [HexChat](http://hexchat.org) and [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/get.html) are popular for Windows.
- Make sure to do diligent research before asking a question on IRC. If your question can be answered via a quick Google search you will only incite ire and lose the respect of your fellow developers.
- Asking questions about your code if fine, but don't paste code directly into the IRC channel. Use a service like [Gist](http://gist.github.com).
- \#rubyonrails channel on irc.freenode.net

### Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is *the* question and answer site for developers. If you have a question that needs answering, make sure to
search the site to see if a similar question has already been asked, otherwise you'll incite the wrath of the Admins.
