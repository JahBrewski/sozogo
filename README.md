## I'm ready to help!
Great! We really appreciate it. Just a few questions:
- Do you have experience working with Ruby/Rails? If so, awesome! Check out our [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page get your development environment set up and dig right in! We use GitHub issues to manage and prioritize our development. Once you've set up your development environment, feel free to fork the project and start working on any open issues. If you have any questions, shoot an email to [Joel](mailto:joelbrewer01@gmail.com) or post a comment on the issue you are working on
- Are you completely new to Rails? No problem! Check out our [New to Rails](new_to_rails.md) page for information on how to get up-to-speed! Don't feel like you need to be an expert to contribute. We facilitate an open environment that seeks to build up new developers. The best way to learn is through doing, so don't be afraid to dig in and get your hands messy.
- Are you interested in helping, but are not a developer? Great! Shoot an email to [Joel](mailto:joelbrewer01@gmail.com) and we'll find a place for you!
