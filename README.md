# About Sozogo
SozoGo is a website that seeks to unite the Church in love and action by giving you the opportunity to volunteer and make the difference you know you were made for. Churches and Christian organizations can make a profile and post volunteering events. Volunteers can then find these events and discover where they would like to serve, searching by their own personal interests, skills, and other criteria. Anyone and everyone can join for free and volunteer today! Plus, earn rewards and badges for volunteering!. [Get involved today](#im-ready-to-help)

## I'm ready to help!
Great! We really appreciate it. Just a few questions:
- Do you have experience working with Ruby/Rails? If so, awesome! Once you've set up your development environment, feel free to fork the project and start working on any open issues. If you have any questions, shoot an email to [Joel](mailto:joelbrewer01@gmail.com) or post a comment on the issue you are working on
- Are you completely new to Rails? No problem! Check out our [New to Rails](new_to_rails.md) page for information on how to get up-to-speed! Don't feel like you need to be an expert to contribute. We facilitate an open environment that seeks to build up new developers. The best way to learn is through doing, so don't be afraid to dig in and get your hands messy.
- Are you interested in helping, but are not a developer? Great! Shoot an email to [Joel](mailto:joelbrewer01@gmail.com) and we'll find a place for you!

## Why should I help?
